## Introduction
The Company Productivity Management System is a Java-based application designed to help companies optimize their employees' productivity by aligning work preferences with productivity goals. Research has shown that allowing employees to work in a manner that suits their preferences, such as working from home, working late, or working early, can lead to increased productivity. This project aims to provide companies with a tool to achieve just that.

By gathering and analyzing data on employees' working preferences and productivity metrics, the Company Productivity Management System provides insights and recommendations on how to improve productivity at both the individual and company levels. With this system, companies can make data-driven decisions to enhance workplace satisfaction and productivity.

## Features
